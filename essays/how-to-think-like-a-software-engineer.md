## Practice, Practice, Practice!

Knowing how to think like a software engineer may be a difficult skill to teach ourselves. We can standardize how we learn to be competent in operating the tools of full stack development. We can spend hours watching tutorials. We can even complete what seems like endless amounts of modules. But from prior experience, knowing how to problem solve and apply knowledge of a programming language or software takes serious time and dedication.

Growing up, I always had a deep passion for STEM. After having taken several Biology and Math courses in my freshman year, I figured that pursuing the Data Science Track at UH MƒÅnoa would be a great fit. Data Science, generally defined, is the process of extracting knowledge from data by collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and gaining insights using scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to make data more understandable and valuable. Software engineering more formally is involved with back-end (server-side software) and front-end (user-interface) development of the software.

While there are slight differences in the technical roles of software engineering, I believe that knowing how to think like a software engineer can achieve optimal results in Data Science. For my future, I hope to master the back-end frameworks for this class, including proficiency with Javascript and creating applications. I also hope to master front-end design, such as HTML and CSS. By thinking like a software engineer, I hope to create even more purposeful projects to solve issues in our community. I hope to gain the essential soft skills necessary, including how to communicate with others, stand up for your ideas, leave no room for error, and successfully work under pressure.
