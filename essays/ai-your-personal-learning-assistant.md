# I. Introduction

A branch of Computer Science that has raised debate in schools, workplaces, companies, etc. is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI systems perform tasks that mimic human behaviors such as language translation, image recognition, and delivering reproduced content and knowledge. Many of these tasks would have needed reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and creativity. 

A popular subset of generative AI systems are Large Language Models (LLMS), foundation models that are trained on a large dataset to _learn_ knowledge to be applied for a specific purpose. The model finds relationships and patterns on the data it is trained on. OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research and deployment company, came out with Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) that does the learning that powers their ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT4.0. Other well-known applications include Google Bard, Bing Chat, Phind, Github Copilot, and more. Updated versions have subsequently been released for each version, based on newer web content, books, Wikipedia articles, news articles, social media posts, code snippets, and more. 

ChatGPT is my go-to generative AI tool and the only one I have used. Personally, many of my classes condone using AI to complete assignments because it is seen akin to cheating. Students are rather encouraged to produce original content and truly show comprehension of the material. Using free, mostly-accurate tools like ChatGPT can put you at risk for plagiarism or various academic consequences. I find it hard to believe that most students would actually have enough self-discipline to not use ChatGPT. The internet is readily at our fingertips.

While taking ICS 314 (Software Engineering) at UH Mānoa, the use of generative AI seems to stand in a middle ground. While we are encouraged to watch solutions to coding exercises and try to do them separately on our own, we are not necessarily penalized for generative AI either. When the time came to submit these exercises, we were required to declare whether we used the help of generative AI or not. Although it ultimately had no bearing on our grade, it was easy to say you did not. In my opinion, coming to terms that the academic landscape is using ChatGPT is crucial. We have to face a new reality that AI is here to stay in education, and we must find the best ways to use it.

# II. Personal Experience With AI in ICS 314

__1. Experience WODS__
I did not use ChatGPT for the Experience WODs, which were coding exercises completed at home. Video solutions are provided and we actually were encouraged to repeat these experiences multiple times to make sure we fully understood the concept. Otherwise it would have avoided the purpose of them in the first place.

__2. In-class Practive WODs__
Similar to the Experience WODs, I was not motivated to use ChatGPT for this. I embraced being stuck since we were able to work with group members and spend the entire class period. There was no penalty on our grade for not being able to find the solution, because it was just practice.

__3. In-class WODS__
I did not use ChatGPT for the in-class WODs as I found that the weekly practice sessions held by the TAs and the online documentations were helpful. We also were not penalized for using the internet, so I had past projects as examples when I got stuck. The solutions from practice exercises for this class were more helpful than ChatGPT responses.

__4. Essays__
I never attempted to use AI in writing my essays or for ideas, in caution of plagiarism. Writing my essays in a typing software like Microsoft Word or Google Docs catches a good amount of errors before I post them to GitHub.

__5. Final Project__
There is no module in the class for how to implement the final project, however we were taught the basics well. I believe that 

# III. Impact on Learning and Comprehension

I believe that ChatGPT was a great tool to get an entry way into learning basic, introductory topics. Depending on how specific your prompt may be, it does a fair job at summarizing or expanding topics. Lecture/reading material for ICS 314 heavily depended on around 30 minute videos, which generally covered what we needed to know. My use of ChatGPT focused on the conversation feature, where I would ask more specific follow up questions. The answers it provided filled in the learning gap from what was covered in the videos. I wouldn’t say that ChatGPT can replace textbooks, official documentation sites, or verified sources that an instructor can provide.

# IV. Practical Applications

For the Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge (HACC), a local group coding competition, we challenged ourselves to use OpenAI as a foundation for our application. It uses keys for security and while trying to understand this I asked it:
 
‘’’
How to set the organization key in the terminal
“‘’
This was the response: 
‘’’
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, OpenAI did not provide a specific "organization key" separate from the API key for individual users. Instead, API keys were used to authenticate API requests, and any organization-specific settings or permissions were typically managed through the OpenAI dashboard.
‘’’
Which is understandable because there was an article that came out a week ago from the time of writing this essay, that actually discusses setting the organization key in the terminal. As warned on its user-interface, the information that ChatGPT provides can often be misleading. APIs are always evolving. In terms of software engineering practices, proper research on the documentation of libraries and frameworks you are using is important. 

I asked Chat GPT to ‘’’ make a light mode and dark mode ‘’’ in which it suggested I use CSS classes and to !important to override certain rules. I did not find this helpful because it did not promote readability if one of my group members were to edit the code. While it certainly worked, I found myself fine tuning whatever it gave me to make sense as if I were producing it myself.  

# V. Challenges and Opportunities

ChatGPT has unexpectedly taught me a new, different skill of how to ask questions to get the answer I want. Over time you realize that the AI only outputs as much information as you give. I found that it would unnecessarily paraphrase prompts given with extra “fluff”. For example if you were to give a single code of line and ask it what the problem is, it won’t give a helpful answer because it simply would not know what the rest of your code is.

In the realm of software engineering, knowing how to ask smart questions is a quintessential aspect to learning. Help from humans through forums such as StackOverflow, Discord, etc. can be extremely helpful—especially if they had the same experience. If your issue is unique, you get left with general steps to take. However, ChatGPT can be treated as a personal coding companion that can give you specific code snippets to try,

At some points, generative AI took away valuable moments of frustration from being stuck or catching up on new material by giving away full answers in seconds. By being inefficient on more complex problems, I probably spent more time fixing that prompt than tracing the code to see what was up. ChatGPT is a great way to start or find a small fix. However we can’t fully rely on it yet for important projects.

# VI. Comparative Analysis

Incorporating generative AI tools like ChatGPT into a Software Engineering class like ICS 314 is promising for students looking into a more hands-on experience. Since ChatGPT can be accessed on any browser, it makes learning accessible. It is a small remedy for anyone who feels that in-person lectures or textbook problems are inefficient. 

Another major factor to learning in Software Engineering is feedback and critique. In ICS 314, we constantly receive feedback, for example about our Project Boards on GitHub or not being descriptive enough in essays. Instructor and Teaching Assistant (TA) feedback response times may vary from a day to a week. However ChatGPT can respond in a matter of seconds. Both are helpful and effective in their own ways. ChatGPT gives “cookie-cutter” responses that can easily be reproduced, while our instructors give more personalized feedback. They may recognize patterns in your work and areas you improved in overtime, which is a skill that only human intelligence is capable of so far. ChatGPT works off the current chat and what you feed it.

# VII. Future Considerations

The technology realm is evolving as you are reading this essay. The free, most accessible version of ChatGPT is ChatGPT-3.5. You can ask an unlimited amount of questions, but the model is only trained on data up until 2022. The efficiency of ChatGPT in a Software Engineering class could be contingent upon the technology stack that will be taught. For example, information about updates in Meteor within a few months ago won’t be available to ChatGPT, so it won’t be able to answer your specific question. 

# VIII. CONCLUSION
Generative AI can’t do our assignments in the Software Engineering Course just yet. Tools like ChatGPT can create a starting point for us and answer our general questions, but it is ultimately up to us, the human programmers, on how we use it.
