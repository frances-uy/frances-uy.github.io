## ICS 314 Final Project Idea - Kye Steele & Frances Uy


## Overview
In today's fast-paced world, where information is abundant, and time is of the essence, the need for an efficient and user-friendly approach to accessing information cannot be overstated. This application should leverage AI to enhance the user experience by providing a flexible and intuitive conversational search function. This technology aims to identify and retrieve relevant Ask Us articles and information while allowing users to engage in "back and forth" conversations. The application is intended for the University of Hawai‘i (UH) community, which consists of students, faculty, staff, and researchers, with a particular focus on welcoming new members to the UH community.

## Mockup Page Ideas
The challenge at hand is to create an AI-powered application that improves access to existing information, primarily addressing frequently asked questions (FAQs). The primary objective is to empower customers, particularly the UH community members, to find the information they need by asking plain-language questions. Instead of having to reach out to a Help Desk human or navigate complex website structures, users will be able to initiate conversations in a more natural and intuitive manner.

## Use Case Ideas
The first step in this endeavor is to enhance the existing UH website with a conversational search function. This enhancement may take the form of a search bar or a chat box. The goal is to make this function integrate seamlessly into the website's interface, ensuring easy access for all users. This way, when someone lands on the UH website seeking information, they can immediately engage with the AI-powered conversational search tool. Users should also be able to log in to the website and save their results for their next visit.

The UH community is vast, with a total of almost 100,000 individuals. This includes students, faculty, staff, and researchers who rely on the university's resources and services for a wide range of needs. Furthermore, the UH community continually welcomes approximately 10,000 to 15,000 new participants each year. As the university grows, so does the need for a more accessible and efficient way of obtaining information. With the introduction of an AI-powered conversational search function, UH community members will have a valuable resource at their disposal. They can simply type or speak their questions in plain language, and the AI will provide accurate and timely responses. This empowers users to independently find answers and resources efficiently.

## Beyond the Basics
One key aspect of this AI application is the ability to engage in "back and forth" conversations. Traditional search engines and FAQ pages often provide static information, leaving users with follow-up questions or the need for clarification. The AI-powered conversational search, however, enables users to have dynamic exchanges with the AI, asking additional questions or seeking elaboration as needed. For example, a new student might ask, "What are the admission requirements?" The AI could respond with the basic criteria, but the user might follow up with, "How do I submit my application?" The AI can seamlessly continue the conversation, making the entire process more engaging and informative.
The creation of an AI-powered application with conversational search capabilities represents a significant step forward in improving the user experience for the UH community. By empowering users to ask questions and engage in "back and forth" conversations, this technology ensures that valuable information is readily accessible. This not only benefits current UH community members but also plays a crucial role in welcoming and assisting the thousands of new participants who join the university every year. Ultimately, this AI-enhanced approach provides a practical and user-centric solution for addressing frequently asked questions, significantly enhancing the overall accessibility of information within the University of Hawai‘i’s digital ecosystem.
