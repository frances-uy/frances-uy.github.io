Whether it be creating your first portfolio on Github or publishing your first project, there are quite a number of “canon events” that every Computer Science student goes through at least some point in their college journey. 

## What is a Canon Event?

In case you haven’t heard of or seen the “canon event” trend on Tiktok this past summer, the term originates from the “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” movie. The film focuses on these “canon” events, which are unavoidable, unchangeable moments that built the Spider-Verse together in big or small ways. In real life, “rite of passage” experiences include Quinceaneras or college freshman picking a pre-med track while still being unsure of their major.

## Canon Events in ICS 314 | Software Engineering Class

Perhaps one of the biggest canon events for any student that takes ICS 314 (Software Engineering) at UH Mānoa, are the Workout of the Days, a.k.a "WODs". For each second class of week during the first 10 weeks of the semester, a WOD is given to help assess how well we know the content for the week. They are essentially timed tests graded under an all or nothing format. These WODS build a productive rhythm of this class by being pressured to really know the material for them and to really make use of practice WODS, through homework or administered by the teaching assistants.

At first, I dreaded the possibility of not completing the WOD _before_ the hard cut-off time to stop. However, it is important to understand _why_ we are putting ourselves through so much trouble in the first place. Beyond the grade, passing WODs means you get to learn effectively and be able to substantially contribute when the final projects for the course come along.

Apparently failure is a part of the process, and it can only do harm when we don't learn from our mistakes. It is possible to fail a few WODS yet still do well in the course. Certainly grades are not the only motivator for myself in this class. I am looking forward to improving my programming skills with the WODS. I believe it will be a great challenge for me. Having done solely individual assignments in the past, it takes a whole other level of preparation upon JavaScript and working under a high-pressure environment.

## Mastering JavaScript

I was a complete newbie to JavaScript. We used Java, Python, and C in my past Computer Science courses. I was surprised to learn for the first time that JavaScript is a completely separate concept, despite its name similarity to Java. While practicing JavaScript I remembered past canon events of forgetting semicolons or brackets, as I was more focused on the technicalities of the language.

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a non-profit organization that provides an interactive learning web platform with thousands of step-by-step lessons, an online community forum, and more. It is free, so it makes learning software development accessible to everyone. I completed their module on JavaScript prior to our first ever WOD. It was good to get the basics down. It was not too difficult to go through the challenges on freeCodeCamp and do some practice WODS, as I discovered the syntax is similar to Java. I am fascinated by the flexibility of JavaScript as it pairs well with HTML and CSS. In regards to ES6(the newer version of JavaScript that was introduced in 2015), I can see how much more efficient it is with newer ways to define variables, object manipulation, and more.

Mastering JavaScript is a canon event that everyone should experience as soon as possible. I think it covers the basics of programming well. I think that its simplicity makes it a great language to learn as a beginner. JavaScript also makes up a big part of the dynamic features on websites, browsers, online apps, video games, and more. It is constantly changing.

Canon events teach us to appreciate every mistake or victory we have. We can use them to motivate us to get better at the WODS or programming overall.
