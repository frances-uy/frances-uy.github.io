Whether it be creating your first portfolio on Github or publishing your first project, there are quite a number of “canon events” that every Computer Science student goes through at least some point in their college journey. 

## What is a Canon Event?

In case you haven’t heard of or seen the “canon event” trend on Tiktok this past summer, the term originates from the “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” movie. The film focuses on these “canon” events, which are unavoidable, unchangeable moments that built the Spider-verse together in big or small ways. In real life, “rite of passage” experiences include Quinceaneras or college freshman picking a pre-med track while still being unsure of their major.

## Canon Events in ICS 314

Perhaps one of the biggest canon events for any student that takes ICS 314 are the Workout of the Day, WODs. Designed after the Athletic Software Engineering Concept, having to complete coding puzzles under a ticking time bomb is daunting. I am looking forward to improving my programming skills with the WODS, I believe it will be a great challenge for me. Having done solely individual assignments in the past, it takes a whole other level of preparation upon Javascript and working under a high-pressure environment in order to meet the expectations and pass.

## Mastering Javascript

I was a complete newbie to Javascript. We used Java, Python, and C in my past ICS courses. I was surprised to learn for the first time that Javascript is a completely separate concept, despite its name similarity to Java. While practicing Javascript I remembered past canon events of forgetting semicolons or brackets, as I was more focused on the technicalities of the language. It was not too difficult to go through the challenges on FreeCodeCamp and do some practice WODS, because the syntax is similar to Java. I am fascinated by the flexibility of Javascript as it pairs well with HTML and CSS. In regards to ES6, I can see how much more efficient it is with newer ways to define variables, object manipulation, and more.

Mastering Javascript is a canon event that everyone should experience as soon as possible. I think it covers the basics of programming well. I think that its simplicity makes it a great language to learn as a beginner. Javascript also makes up a big part of the dynamic features on websites, browsers, online apps, video games, and more. It is constantly changing.

Canon events teach us to appreciate every mistake or victory we have. We can use them to motivate us to get better at the WODS or programming overall.
