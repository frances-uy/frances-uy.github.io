This is a final project completed while I was a part of a computer science program at UH Manoa, AI4All— A learning initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Ignited by recent news about increased data tracking on social media platforms, we wanted to understand how social media companies’ marketing and algorithms targets us and the hidden ethical implications behind them. Specifically, we wanted to understand how what we view might affect what political ads are presented to us.

As a team member, I worked with two other computer science students to showcase our knowledge of cleaning and manipulating data to propose an issue or problem. We used a data set from Kaggle and Jupyter notebook to perform our tasks. My role was to find a reliable data set and clean it up. It was a great way to also learn Python, apply Decision Trees, operate Anaconda Navigator, and overall team collaboration.
