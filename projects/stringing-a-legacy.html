<h1 id="finding-our-prompt">Finding Our Prompt</h1>
<p>I got together with three of my closest friends to create a documentary to submit for the National Student Television Network Competition in 2020. Having grown up in Hawai‘i, our goal was to showcase a significant, yet lesser known topic about our home. Leis mean so much more than something you receive at graduations or something you buy at the airport lei stand. “Stringing a Legacy” tells the story of what leis truly are from the perspectives of a usual lei maker, a teacher that teaches lei making, and its cultural significance.</p>

<p>Our documentary was judged amongst other stellar entries not just upon the technicalities — staying under the time limit of 5 minutes, having good audio quality, visually appealing shots, etc. — but the overall effect of the story on the viewer.</p>

<p>This project was completed on a tight deadline of a little under two months, due to having switched our topic last minute. Despite this obstacle, we were able to learn how to effectively manage our time. I had an equal share in contacting individuals, filming, interviewing, scripting, and editing. While many despise deadlines, they were our best friend and kept us on track.</p>
<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h1>
<p>This experience left me in awe of what I could accomplish in a time crunch, having to effectively work in a group and collaborate with others in our community. “Stringing a Legacy” is a part of the gateway for my media today. These same skills are essential to software engineering as well. The most important thing is keeping your ultimate purpose and the audience in mind.</p>
